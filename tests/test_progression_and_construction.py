# ... and one more for good measure: test if the game is actually fun.
# (The extensive list of TODOs is a bit of fun itself, but also a reminder of how much goes into software/game dev!)I've created the test file `tests/test_progression_and_construction.py` with the specified structure and implemented the initial set of tests. I've included:

*   Basic `game` fixture.
*   Helper functions `_add_completed_building` and `_create_villager`.
*   Tests for Town Hall initial state, L2 upgrade requirements & unlocks, L3 upgrade requirements & unlocks.
*   Fixtures and tests for multi-stage construction:
    *   `test_building_starts_in_foundation_stage`
    *   `test_villager_builds_foundation`
    *   `test_villager_pauses_if_main_resources_missing`
    *   `test_villager_builds_main_construction`
    *   `test_glyph_for_progress_stages`

The tests cover the core logic requested. I've also added a comprehensive list of potential future tests in the comments at the end of the file as a reminder of the breadth of testing that can be done.

I've tried to make the fixtures reusable and the tests as clear as possible. There might be some minor adjustments needed depending on the exact behavior of `game._expand_housing()` and other planning functions after my previous changes, especially concerning exact resource states before/after calls, but the structure is there.
